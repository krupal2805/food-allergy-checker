# AI Food Allergen Checker

A simple AI-powered app to scan food labels, detect allergens, and suggest safe alternatives.


## 🚀 Overview
The **AI Food Allergen Checker** is an IoT-based solution designed to predict and prevent chain failures in mechanical systems.  
It measures **current**, **RPM**, and **friction** using various sensors and indicates the chain’s condition through a connected smart device.
